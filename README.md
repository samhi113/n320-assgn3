# Assignment 3

## Overview
This project consists of a custom-built host, hosting a simple, DOM-manipulating site. It can load HTML, CSS, JS, and GIF files (but only the ones I coded in :P)

## Render Link

## Hardships
I struggled a lot with the server-side loading of materials. yeesh that was difficult. Turns out loading each file with the same method was the way to go.

## What I Learned (from a coding perspective)
Sometimes you need a completely new perspective. I thought one thing was the issue when over and over it was a complete different. Also, apparently, you're supposed to occasionally reload the server thingy?? That's new but it makes some sense ig.
